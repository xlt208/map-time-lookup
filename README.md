# Map Time Lookup

A personal learning project built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/), and the [Calcite Design System](https://developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/).

Click on the map to capture a location and see its current local time. Each click adds another time entry so you can compare multiple time zones at once.
